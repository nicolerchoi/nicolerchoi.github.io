      "Melt the butter in a pan. When it starts bubbling, add all purpose flour and keep stirring it at low heat.",
      "When it starts to release a buttery/cakey smell, add cold cream and chicken stock, and stir for 1-2 minutes.",
      "Add chicken thigh, carrots and potatoes into the sauce and mix well. Add more chicken stock if need to. Put a lid on and cook for 5 minutes at low heat.",
      "Check that the sauce has simmered and thickened. If you get some sauce onto a spoon, and wipe it off with a finger. If the liquid doesn't close the gap, the sauce has the right consistency.",
      "Add mushrooms and peas, and cooked with the lid on for 1-2 minutes.",
      "Add some salt to taste and serve."
